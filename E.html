	   <h2>Fun facts about elements:</h2>
	  <div>
	   <ul>
		 <li>The Periodic Table: The periodic table of elements organizes all known elements based
			 on their properties and atomic numbers. It's like a map of the elements!</li>
			 <li>The Most Abundant Element: Hydrogen is the most abundant element 
				in the universe, making up about 75% of its elemental mass.</li>
			 <li>Mercury is a Liquid Metal: Mercury (Hg) is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature. It's also
					 highly toxic, so it must be handled with care.</li>
			 <li>Gold's Unreactive Nature: Gold (Au) is known for its rarity and beauty. It doesn't corrode or tarnish,
					  which is why it has been used in jewelry and currency for centuries.</li>
			 <li>Helium's Voice-Change Effect: Inhaling helium (He) changes the pitch of your voice 
			 because it's less dense than air, causing sound waves to travel faster.</li>
			 <li>The Noble Gases: Elements in the noble gas group, like helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar), are colorless,
				 odorless, and typically inert, making them useful in applications like lighting and lasers.</li>
